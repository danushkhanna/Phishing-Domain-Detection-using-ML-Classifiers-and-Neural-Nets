st.markdown("### *Abstract*")
st.markdown("Phishing stands for a fraudulent process, where an attacker tries to obtain sensitive information from the victim. Usually, these kinds of attacks are done via emails, text messages, or websites. Phishing websites, which are nowadays in a considerable rise, have the same look as legitimate sites. However, their backend is designed to collect sensitive information that is inputted by the victim. Discovering and detecting phishing websites has recently also gained the machine learning communityâ€™s attention, which has built the models and performed classifications of phishing websites. This paper presents two dataset variations that consist of 58,645 and 88,647 websites labeled as legitimate or phishing and allow the researchers to train their classification models, build phishing detection systems, and mining association rules.")
st.markdown("### *Value of the Data*")
st.markdown("- These data consist of a collection of legitimate, as well as phishing website instances. Each website is represented by the set of features that denote whether the website is legitimate or not. Data can serve as input for the machine learning process.")
st.markdown("- Machine learning and data mining researchers can benefit from these datasets, while also computer security researchers and practitioners. Computer security enthusiasts can find these datasets interesting for building firewalls, intelligent ad blockers, and malware detection systems.")            
st.markdown("- This dataset can help researchers and practitioners easily build classification models in systems preventing phishing attacks since the presented datasets feature the attributes which can be easily extracted.")
st.markdown("- Finally, the provided datasets could also be used as a performance benchmark for developing state-of-the-art machine learning methods for the task of phishing websites classification.")
